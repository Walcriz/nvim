# My Personal Neovim Configuration
This neovim configuration was heavly inspired by the [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) neovim configuration.

## Plugin Manager
- The [ðŸ’¤lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager.

## Autocompletion
This config uses the built in lsp as its autocompletion with luasnip for snippets. Some languages also
use [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) instead.

### Special languages
```
C# - Uses the omnisharp.vim plugin
Java - coc.nvim
```

## Theme
I am using a modified [monokai pro](https://monokai.pro/) theme based from the
[monokai.nvim](https://github.com/tanvirtin/monokai.nvim) vim colorscheme.

## Requirements
- Neovim >= **0.8.0**
- Git >= **2.19.0**
- [RipGrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- Node.js >= **v18.11.0** **(Only required for languages that use coc.nvim)**
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) **(To build coc.nvim from source)**
- [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/JetBrainsMono) **(optional)**

## Notes

### Windows
- On windows (right now) to use treesitters [**html** and **yaml** parsers](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/3587)
you need to remove the `libstdc++-6.dll`
file in neovim's installiation files. (This is to make it use the system installed one **MAKE SURE TO HAVE gcc INSTALLED**)
- The coc-lua extension does not work

### WSL
- In wsl i would recommend not writing C# code in wsl write that in windows native instead
(spoiler alert: **It is a pain to set up with [omnisharp.vim](https://github.com/OmniSharp/Omnisharp-vim)**)
- I would recommend to install [GWSL](https://opticos.github.io/gwsl/) for its clipboard sync feature

### Neovim 0.9
- In neovim the `nvim/lua/plugins/nvim07.lua` file is not needed and is safe to [delete](https://github.com/gpanders/editorconfig.nvim)

## Installation

- Make a backup of your prevous config
- `git clone` this repository into your neovim config path (Linux: `~/.config/nvim`, Windows: `C:\Users\[Your Name]\AppData\Local\nvim`)
- Start neovim and wait
- ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations you now have my configuration installed!
