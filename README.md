# My Personal Neovim Configuration
This neovim configuration was at first inspired by [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) for nvim 0.8 so a lot of the directory structure is the same. But that was a long time ago now so there is really nothing in common between them anymore.

## Plugin Manager
- The [ðŸ’¤lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager.

## Autocompletion
This config uses the built in lsp as its autocompletion with luasnip for snippets.

## Theme
I am using a modified [monokai pro](https://monokai.pro/) theme based from the
[monokai.nvim](https://github.com/tanvirtin/monokai.nvim) vim colorscheme.

## Requirements
- Neovim >= **0.11.0**
- Git
- [RipGrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/JetBrainsMono) (You can use any Nerd Font font)

## Notes

### WSL
- I would recommend to install [GWSL](https://opticos.github.io/gwsl/) for its clipboard sync feature

## Installation

- Make a backup of your previous neovim config
- `git clone` this repository into your neovim config path (Linux: `~/.config/nvim`, Windows: `C:\Users\[Your Name]\AppData\Local\nvim`)
- Start neovim and wait
- ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations you now have my configuration installed!
